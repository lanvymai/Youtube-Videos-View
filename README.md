## Project Overview

This data science project explores the relationships between different variables and YouTube video views. The analysis includes handling missing values, correlation analysis, and various visualizations to understand the factors affecting video popularity.

# The dataset

In this project, I used [Kaggle Data Science Youtube Video Meta Data](https://www.kaggle.com/themlphdstudent/data-science-youtube-video-meta-data) collected by The ML PhD Student
> ## Overview of the dataset
> - 44,261 Youtube videos, 60 channels
> - Time series data from 2006-2020
> - 21 variables in total
> - Data available for Channels, View, Comments, Duration in seconds, Likes & Dislikes, Video Quality, and Caption, etc.
> - Four unique categories of interest


## Key Visualizations

1. Correlation matrix
![Correlation Matrix](path/to/correlation_matrix.png)
3. Linear model plots of likes to views for selected video categories
4. Linear model plots of comments to views for selected video categories
5. Relational plots of views, comments, and video quality for selected categories
6. Relational plots of views, likes, and video caption for selected categories
7. Count of video categories in the dataset
8. View distribution across all video categories
9. Distribution of views, comments, likes, and duration variables
10. Distribution of log-transformed views, comments, likes, and duration variables

## Data Preprocessing

The project involved handling missing values in the dataset. Visualizations of the data before and after handling missing values are included in the analysis.

## Analysis Highlights

- Exploration of relationships between likes, comments, and views for different video categories
- Investigation of the impact of video quality and captions on view counts
- Examination of view distribution across various video categories
- Analysis of the distribution of key variables (views, comments, likes, duration) and their log-transformed versions

## Results

The project provides insights into the factors that influence YouTube video views through various statistical analyses and visualizations. For detailed results, please refer to the full project documentation and code.

## Future Work

Potential areas for future exploration include:
- Deeper analysis of specific video categories
- Incorporation of additional variables that may affect view counts
- Time-series analysis of view trends
