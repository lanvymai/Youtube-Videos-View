Project Overview
This data science project explores the relationships between different variables and YouTube video views. The analysis includes handling missing values, correlation analysis, and various visualizations to understand the factors affecting video popularity.
Key Visualizations
Correlation matrix
Linear model plots of likes to views for selected video categories
Linear model plots of comments to views for selected video categories
Relational plots of views, comments, and video quality for selected categories
Relational plots of views, likes, and video caption for selected categories
Count of video categories in the dataset
View distribution across all video categories
Distribution of views, comments, likes, and duration variables
Distribution of log-transformed views, comments, likes, and duration variables
Data Preprocessing
The project involved handling missing values in the dataset. Visualizations of the data before and after handling missing values are included in the analysis.
Analysis Highlights
Exploration of relationships between likes, comments, and views for different video categories
Investigation of the impact of video quality and captions on view counts
Examination of view distribution across various video categories
Analysis of the distribution of key variables (views, comments, likes, duration) and their log-transformed versions
Results
The project provides insights into the factors that influence YouTube video views through various statistical analyses and visualizations. For detailed results, please refer to the full project documentation and code.
Future Work
Potential areas for future exploration include:
